Genshin Worst Case Wish Calculator

Hi everyone this is my first actual JavaFX project that's made 100% on my own goal and rules 
so if you have any critiques please let me know so I can try to make better apps in the future.

===============================================================================================
REQUIREMENTS

So to use this you need Java 21 and JavaFX 22.
And since this app needs a VM arugment to launch I will provide the .bat file to launch the app
and I will put the argument here also
java --module-path "Your JavaFX lib path here" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar GWCWC.jar
===============================================================================================
How to use
1. simply put in the primogems amount on the first text field
2. next put in the amount of intertwined fate that you have
3. and then check the box if you have 50/50 on
4. and then lastly put in the amount of characters you want (up to 7, so if you want a C6 of this character but you don't have them already then input 7)
5. press calculate and the calculator will calculate the results for you
===============================================================================================
if there are any defects with the app please let me know so I can fix them.
Thank you for using my app :D
